[Video Saliency Detection with Domain Adaption using Hierarchical Gradient Reversal Layers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.01220)
## Notes

- The code for train and test is an adapted version of the original available [here](https://github.com/MichiganCOG/TASED-Net).

- As Feature Extractor, SalGradNet employs S3D pretained on Kinetics-400 dataset. The S3D weights can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/kylemin/S3D).

- The whole SalGradNet weights trained on [DHF1K](https://mmcheng.net/videosal/) dataset can be downloaded from [here]().
